    <string name="shakib_details">When the annals of Bangladesh cricket are sifted by future generations, Shakib Al
        Hasan will emerge and re-emerge as the greatest cricketer of its first two decades. His on-field performances
        and off-field professionalism set a benchmark that was followed by peers and juniors alike. As a bowler, Shakib
        is accurate, consistent and canny; aggression and a wide range of strokes are the keys to his batting. Even more
        importantly, he has self-belief an excellent temperament, unflustered by the big occasion and ready to do battle
        against the top teams.
